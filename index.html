                    (fr. Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire, CERN), by Tim Bernere
                    Sir Timothy John «Tim» Berners Lee (World Wide Web (WWW))
                    developed the concept. If before email information only specific
                    It could be sent to the addressee, Tim Berners Lee
                    He wanted to further simplify the dissemination of information.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                His idea, at first glance,
                  Simple and from today's point of view
                   It was completely natural. Mail is a kind of computer
                   A file that contains some digital information. Yes
                   We may not send this file, information, to a specific addressee,
                    But put it on the Internet and let interested people see it there.
                     A website is a computer file on one of the servers of the Internet
                  lies and anyone can open it.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Developers use several software tools to build a website.
                   The most common of which are:

                <p class="section-discraption">For those people who are looking at the website
                    They create the face, they are called web developers. Also they often
                    They are also called Front End Developers, which emphasizes that
                    that they form the Front of the website, i.e. the part that
                     with which the user interacts. For some, perhaps
                     It sounds strange, but building a website is a creative process.
                     Because a web developer always has to create a new, different website
                     has to. Web development is usually a team effort, and several
                     It consists of a stage. Web designers create website designs. Then
                     Web developers build the website according to the approved design.
                     Back-end developers may also be involved in this process. when
                     The website is ready, testers are involved in the work.
                    They check how well they are doing through the testing process
                     The site is working.</p>
